[WIP]

I recently completed my Post-graduate and am looking to start my career in AI Safety Research. Previously, I come from an AI and Software Engineering background where my most recent experiences were based around the public sector and delivering AI based solutions.

<!-- I would say I am a generalist in nature -  -->

<!-- What inspired my transition to AI Safety is ... -->

<!-- On the side, I am involved at a local youths-based non-profit organisation serving as the current Data/AI Technical Lead. Also, I am the head AI Trainer at a local robotics and coding academy.  -->





<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->

<!-- Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
