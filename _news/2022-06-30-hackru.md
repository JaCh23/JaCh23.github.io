HackRU 2022 was a blast! It was a fruitful experience participating in the largest student hackathon in Israel alongside hundreds of the most innovative and talented students in the country.

We are honored to have been in the Top 2 teams in the HackRU Playtika Challenge! I learnt significantly about data science and realized a hackathon is more than just coding, itâ€™s about having a multi-disciplinary team working together to create a holistic product. Shoutout to my amazing team for the huge efforts.

Thanks to Playtika for providing a great challenge on data science and an AI-based social game experience. Also biggest thanks to the HackRU team and Reichman University for organizing this event!
